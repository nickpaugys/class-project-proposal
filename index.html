  <h1>After the fact...</h1>
  <p>In my proposal, I set out to make a sandbox drawing application with some basic and advanced 
    features that included being able to change the color that you draw in, being able to change 
    the color of the drawing canvas, being able to change the thickness of the lines you were 
    drawing in, and implementing clear/back buttons.</p>
  <p>All of this ended up being delivered in this final project.</p>
  <p>If I had more time, I think I would've tried to find a way so that you can scroll through
     several different canvases at once, as if to simulate multiple different pages in a 
     notebook.</p>
